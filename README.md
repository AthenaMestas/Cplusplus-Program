# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The C++ program was developed to track the frequency of items from a text file for a store's strategic arrangement. Beyond using the program to 
have a more intentional store layout, implementation of the code could be found beneficial for data analysis, management of inventory, or any other
purpose where frequency tracking is applicable. The program's main menu gives a few options for letting the user decide how they want to view the data:
Menu option 1 allows the user to search for a specific item's frequency, option 2 displays all items found in the file along with their frequencies, 
option 3 displays a color-coded histogram of all items' frequencies, and option 4 allows the user to quit the program.

# What did you do particularly well?
Key strengths in the project include thorough documentation and an organized coding style. Each function and complicated statement is well-described,
which enhances readability and, therefore, maintainability. The script is organized into 3 files (4 files if you count the temporary test text file) so
that the main logic is clear and adheres to good practices.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
To enhance my code, I could implement more error handling. While the program offers multiple input validations, there could be a more robust system of them.
Specifically, when dealing with file operations, I could add more detailed error messages to describe what specific difficulty the program is facing. Doing so 
would enhance the security and user experience when using the program.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of the code to write was the menu options, as having each case call another class function and making sure the function being called
would work properly was a bit of a headache. To overcome the challenge, in addition to mapping out the system on a whiteboard, I was careful with the use of loops, input validation, and condition statements. Adding to my support network, I utilized C++ online forums, documentation, and other sites that gave solutions to micro-problems in the writing process.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Through my educational endeavors, foundational knowledge in C++, file handling, and thorough documentation are skills that will be necessary to have. Building a strong foundation in C++ will allow me to build upon that knowledge in future courses to produce continuously more advanced work. Having the fundamental skill of file handling will do me well as it opens doors in my educational field and will be applicable to a majority of future projects. Practicing thoroughly documenting 
my code will not only enhance the readability of all my future projects, but it also helps me to learn as I am actively describing what the coding section is doing.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The clear structure and detailed comments are the main workhorse in making the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable. The organized and clean structure
allows for easy visualization of how each section flows together. The abundant comments allow others or myself to come into the program and understand the structure while seeing the human-language to know which specific parts need modified if the program is expected to behave differently.
